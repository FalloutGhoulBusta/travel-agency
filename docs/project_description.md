## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components

* **Responsive Design Framework**

  * Mobile-first layout built with the Bootstrap 5 grid system and custom CSS.
  * Flexible breakpoints ensure layouts adapt smoothly from mobile to desktop.
  * Consistent design language with a defined color palette (e.g., primary dark blue #2c3e50, secondary blue #3498db, accent red #e74c3c) and typography (Segoe UI stack).
  * Optimized asset loading (minification, lazy-loading of images, use of WebP format) for fast page rendering.

* **User Interface Elements**

  * Dynamic navigation bar with smooth scrolling effects; changes opacity or style on scroll.
  * Hero sections with full-viewport image carousels (auto-rotating every 5 seconds) including caption overlays and prominent call-to-action buttons.
  * Interactive forms across the site (search, booking, registration, newsletter) with client-side validation and instant feedback for users.
  * Toast notification system to display success/error messages for form submissions and actions.
  * Lazy loading of non-critical images and scroll-triggered animations (via Intersection Observer) for performance and engagement.

* **Template and Theming System**

  * Modular PHP templates for reusable components (header, footer, navigation) with conditional rendering based on user state (guest, user, or admin).
  * Centralized `functions.php` or similar utilities file providing common functionality (database connection, input sanitization, CSRF token generation, redirect helpers).
  * Thematic consistency enforced via shared CSS variables and classes: colors, fonts, and spacing defined in one place.
  * Responsive footer layout with columns for company info, quick links, and contact details, automatically adjusting on smaller screens.

### Backend Architecture

* **Server Environment**

  * PHP 7.4+ backend hosted on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL).
  * Use of PDO (PHP Data Objects) with prepared statements for all database operations to ensure security and error handling.
  * Exception-based error handling; database and application errors are caught and logged.
  * Sensitive configuration (database credentials, API keys) stored in secured environment/config files, not in web-accessible paths.

* **API System**

  * RESTful PHP endpoints to support AJAX interactions (e.g., `/api_add_to_cart.php`, `/api_get_packages.php`, `/get_login_status.php`).
  * JSON is used for data interchange between frontend JavaScript and backend.
  * Endpoints include cart management (add/remove items), package retrieval (with JOIN on destinations), authentication status check, and chatbot message handling.
  * CORS headers configured to allow safe cross-origin requests (e.g., from a frontend development server) and CSRF tokens validated on state-changing requests.

* **Database Schema**

  * Relational MySQL schema with the following core tables:

    * **Users:** stores `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (ENUM user/admin), `created_at`.
    * **Destinations:** stores `id`, `name`, `description`, `image_url`, `base_price`, `country`.
    * **Packages:** stores `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `duration_days`, `status` (active/inactive), with a foreign key `destination_id` referencing Destinations.
    * **Bookings:** stores `id`, `user_id` (FK to Users), `package_id` (FK to Packages), `travel_date`, `number_of_people`, `status` (pending/confirmed/canceled).
  * Strong referential integrity enforced (foreign keys, ON DELETE behaviors).
  * Indexing on key columns (e.g. foreign keys, frequently searched fields) for performance.
  * Automated database initialization script: creates the database and tables if they do not exist, with error handling to log setup issues.

* **Security Implementation**

  * Passwords hashed using a secure algorithm (e.g., `password_hash` with bcrypt).
  * Input validation and sanitization across the application (server-side PHP checks and client-side JS checks).
  * Protection against SQL injection via PDO prepared statements on all database queries.
  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention through output escaping (e.g., `htmlspecialchars`) for any user-generated content.
  * CSRF token usage on form submissions and sensitive API endpoints.
  * Encrypted session cookies with HTTP-only flags; session fixation protection and idle timeout (e.g. 30 minutes).
  * CORS policy restricting allowed origins (only trusted frontends) and enforcing credentials only when needed.
  * Rate limiting on critical operations (e.g., login attempts, chat requests) to mitigate abuse.

### AI Chatbot System

* **Frontend Integration**

  * Chat interface implemented (e.g. in React with TypeScript) and embedded as a floating component via `header.php`, making it accessible on every page.
  * Smooth UI/UX with animations (e.g. via Framer Motion) for opening/closing the chat and new message transitions.
  * Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap utilities) used for consistent styling of the chat window, input field, and message bubbles.
  * Client-side state management (React Context or similar) to track conversation context and session data.

* **NLP and Conversational Intelligence**

  * Integration with a hosted language model (e.g. Qwen 2.5-1.5B Instruct) via REST API for interpreting user messages.
  * Intent recognition to detect common travel-related requests (destination info, package inquiries, booking operations).
  * Entity extraction for key details (dates, numbers, locations, party size, price constraints).
  * Sentiment analysis to monitor user mood and adjust the dialogue style if necessary.
  * Conversation state tracking for multi-turn dialogues, with context preservation between sessions.
  * Fallback responses for unrecognized inputs and error handling when the AI service is unavailable.

* **Backend Services**

  * PHP-based endpoints supporting the chatbot, such as `/api/chat/message` (handle incoming messages), `/api/chat/history` (retrieve past conversation with TTL), and `/api/chat/packages` (query package data based on context).
  * Session-aware processing: checks user login status and attaches user context to requests (allowing the bot to offer personalized recommendations).
  * Caching layer to store recent AI responses and conversation state (e.g. 1-hour TTL) to improve performance on repeated queries.
  * Rate limiting (e.g. 10 requests per minute per user) to manage load on the AI service.
  * Graceful degradation: if the AI service fails, the bot provides a default apologetic message and logs the error.
  * Integration points with booking logic: the bot can trigger actual booking workflows by interfacing with the booking system, subject to user confirmation and authentication.

## Non-Functional Characteristics

* **Performance Metrics**

  * Target response time under 2 seconds for most user interactions (page loads, form submissions, API calls).
  * First Contentful Paint (FCP) optimized to <1.5 seconds on initial page load.
  * Scalability to handle 100+ concurrent users without noticeable slowdown.
  * Optimized asset delivery: use of CDNs for libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome), minified CSS/JS, and image optimization (WebP format, lazy loading).

* **Security Standards**

  * All user passwords are securely hashed; sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS).
  * Strict input validation and output escaping at every entry point to prevent injection and XSS attacks.
  * CSRF tokens on forms and secure session management to protect against hijacking.
  * HTTP security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) configured for hardened protection.
  * CORS whitelist enforced for any cross-origin requests.
  * Audit logging of critical operations (e.g. failed login attempts, admin actions).

* **Accessibility**

  * Use of semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, etc.) for screen-reader compatibility.
  * ARIA attributes on dynamic components (carousel controls, modals, form validation regions) for assistive technologies.
  * Support for keyboard navigation across all features (e.g. tabbing through menu items and forms).
  * Sufficient color contrast ratios and a reduced-motion mode to accommodate different user needs.
  * Descriptive alt text for all images (especially in destination listings and package galleries).

* **Usability and User Experience**

  * Intuitive navigation structure with clear labels (Destinations, Packages, About, Contact) and visible authentication links (Login/Register/Account).
  * Consistent UI patterns (buttons, cards, forms) across the site for a cohesive feel.
  * Immediate feedback on user actions: form inputs validate on-the-fly, and toast notifications summarize the outcome (e.g. “Booking confirmed”, “Error adding to cart”).
  * Error messages presented in a user-friendly manner, guiding users to corrective action without technical jargon.
  * Responsive layouts that maintain readability and functionality on small screens (collapsed menus, stacked cards, touch-friendly controls).

* **Maintainability**

  * Modular code organization: separation of concerns between frontend templates, backend logic, and utility functions.
  * Documented code and clear configuration (e.g. database setup script, environment variables) to aid future updates.
  * CSS and JS frameworks (Bootstrap, possibly Tailwind) allow for easy theming changes.
  * Use of version control and consistent coding standards to facilitate collaborative development and maintenance.

* **Browser Compatibility**

  * Full support for the latest versions of major browsers: Chrome (and Chromium-based Edge), Firefox, Safari.
  * Progressive enhancement ensures basic functionality even if advanced features are not supported (e.g. polyfill for `IntersectionObserver`, fallbacks for older browsers).
  * Graceful degradation: if JavaScript is disabled or a browser is outdated, the user can still navigate core content and receive appropriate messaging.

## User Interface and Experience

* **Design & Theming**

  * A cohesive visual design system with a defined color palette and typography ensures brand consistency.
  * UI components (buttons, cards, form fields) use Bootstrap styles customized with project-specific themes (primary/secondary colors).
  * UI consistency through shared CSS classes and variables so that updates to the theme reflect site-wide.

* **Responsive and Adaptive Layout**

  * The layout is mobile-first: grid-based pages and navigation collapse elegantly on smaller screens.
  * Interactive elements (hamburger menu, touch carousels) enhance mobile usability.
  * Content containers adjust fluidly, ensuring text remains readable and controls accessible on any device size.

* **Accessibility**

  * ARIA labels and roles on interactive controls (carousels, modals, chat) assist screen readers.
  * Focus indicators and skip-navigation links improve keyboard usability.
  * Designs account for reduced-motion preferences and provide alternate text for images.

* **Error Handling and Feedback**

  * Client-side form validation with clear inline error messages helps users correct mistakes immediately.
  * On submission errors (network issues or validation failures), the interface displays friendly notifications (e.g. toast alerts) explaining the problem.
  * Graceful fallbacks for network/API failures: the app can retry requests, show cached data, or guide the user to refresh as needed.

* **Browser Compatibility & Progressive Enhancement**

  * The application is tested on modern browsers and maintains core functionality on older versions.
  * Polyfills or fallbacks are used for newer web APIs to ensure graceful degradation (e.g. if `IntersectionObserver` is unavailable, images still load normally).
  * CSS and JS features leverage vendor prefixes or alternatives as needed to cover a broad audience.
